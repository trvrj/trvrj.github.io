        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how TRVRJ APPS ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects information in connection with our mobile applications, websites, and related services (collectively, the "Services").</p>

        <p>By using any TRVRJ APPS product, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of our Services.</p>

        <h2>1. Scope</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile apps and games published by TRVRJ APPS, including both online and offline experiences. Some apps may not use all the features described here.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        
        <p>a. Information You Provide</p>
        <p>Some apps may ask for voluntary information (e.g., when contacting us or submitting feedback).</p>

        <p>b. Automatically Collected Information</p>
        <p>Depending on the app, we may collect:</p>
        <p>- Device information (model, OS version, system language)<br>
        - App usage statistics and performance data<br>
        - Crash reports and diagnostic logs</p>
        <p>Offline-only apps typically do not collect or transmit any personal data.</p>

        <p>c. Third-Party Services</p>
        <p>Some TRVRJ APPS products may integrate with third-party tools, such as:</p>
        <p>- Analytics (e.g., Firebase Analytics)<br>
        - Advertising (e.g., AdMob)<br>
        - Cloud Saves / Leaderboards (e.g., Google Play Games)</p>
        <p>If a specific app uses any such service, you will be notified within that app. Each service has its own privacy policy governing the use of data.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We may use collected data to:</p>
        <p>- Improve performance and stability<br>
        - Diagnose issues and debug problems<br>
        - Understand general usage trends<br>
        - Provide customer support<br>
        - Deliver updates and new features</p>
        <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We may share data only:</p>
        <p>- With service providers who process data on our behalf (under strict privacy terms)<br>
        - If required by law, regulation, or legal process<br>
        - To protect our rights, property, or users</p>
        <p>We never share data for marketing or advertising purposes outside of what's explicitly disclosed.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes described above or as required by law. Offline apps typically store all information locally on your device and we do not have access to it.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our apps are not directed at children under 13 years old (or under 16 in the EU) unless explicitly stated. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>
        <p>If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:trevor@trvrj.com">trevor@trvrj.com</a> and we will promptly delete it.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>
        <p>- Access or request a copy of your data<br>
        - Request correction or deletion of your data<br>
        - Object to certain processing<br>
        - Withdraw consent (where applicable)</p>
        <p>To exercise these rights, email <a href="mailto:trevor@trvrj.com">trevor@trvrj.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. No system is perfectly secure, so users share information at their own risk.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.</p>
        <p>The "Last Updated" date indicates the most recent revision. Continued use of our apps means you accept the updated policy.</p>
